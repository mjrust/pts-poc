This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:5050) with your browser to see the result.

## CREATING A BUNDLE

```zsh
yarn build
```

This will create an `out` directory

```zsh
yarn global add serve
or
npx serve
```

Run serve with any port you like

```zsh
serve -p 5050
```
